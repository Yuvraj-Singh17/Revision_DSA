Hint
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen , r - l + 1);
                r++;
            }else{

                l++;
