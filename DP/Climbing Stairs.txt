Hint
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 45












class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int[] arr = new int[n+1];
        Arrays.fill(arr,-1);
        return helper(n , arr);
    }
    public int helper(int n , int[] arr){
        if(n == 1 || n == 2) return n;

        if(arr[n] != -1){
            return arr[n];
        }

        arr[n] = helper(n-1 , arr) + helper(n-2 , arr);
        return arr[n];
    }
}
