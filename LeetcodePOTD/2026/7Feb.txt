Hint
You are given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'​​​​.

You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'.

Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aababbab"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can either:
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbaaaaabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: The only solution is to delete the first two characters.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is 'a' or 'b'​​.



class Solution {
    public int minimumDeletions(String s) {
        int n = s.length();

        int counta = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'a')
                counta++;
        }

        int count = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int countb = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'a')
                counta--;
            count = Math.min(count, countb + counta);

            if (s.charAt(i) == 'b')
                countb++;
        }

        return count;
        
    }
}
