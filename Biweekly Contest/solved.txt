Hint
You are given an integer num.

A number num is called a Complete Prime Number if every prefix and every suffix of num is prime.

Return true if num is a Complete Prime Number, otherwise return false.

Note:

A prefix of a number is formed by the first k digits of the number.
A suffix of a number is formed by the last k digits of the number.
Single-digit numbers are considered Complete Prime Numbers only if they are prime.
 

Example 1:

Input: num = 23

Output: true

Explanation:

​​​​​​​Prefixes of num = 23 are 2 and 23, both are prime.
Suffixes of num = 23 are 3 and 23, both are prime.
All prefixes and suffixes are prime, so 23 is a Complete Prime Number and the answer is true.
Example 2:

Input: num = 39

Output: false

Explanation:

Prefixes of num = 39 are 3 and 39. 3 is prime, but 39 is not prime.
Suffixes of num = 39 are 9 and 39. Both 9 and 39 are not prime.
At least one prefix or suffix is not prime, so 39 is not a Complete Prime Number and the answer is false.
Example 3:

Input: num = 7

Output: true

Explanation:

7 is prime, so all its prefixes and suffixes are prime and the answer is true.
 

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 109
